# Getting Started

Install with npm: `npm i redux-promise-middleware -S`

## Usage

First, import the middleware and include it in `applyMiddleware` when creating the Redux store:

```js
import promiseMiddleware from 'redux-promise-middleware';

composeStoreWithMiddleware = applyMiddleware(
  promiseMiddleware()
)(createStore);

```

To use the middleware, dispatch a promise within the `payload` of the action and specify a `type` string. You may pass an optional `data` object. This is dispatched from the pending action and is useful for optimistic updates.

The pending action is dispatched immediately with the original type string and a suffix of `_PENDING`. The fulfilled action is dispatched only if the promise is resolved, e.g., if it was successful; and the rejected action is dispatched only if the promise is rejected, e.g., if an error occurred. The fulfilled and rejected suffixes are `_FULFILLED` and `_REJECTED` respectively. If necessary, it is possible [to change the value](#type-suffix-configuration) of the type suffixes.

```js
export function myAsyncActionCreator(data) {
  return {
    type: 'ACTION',
    payload: {
      promise: doSomethingAsyncAndReturnPromise(data),
      data: data
    }
  };
}
```

The middleware returns a [FSA compliant](https://github.com/acdlite/flux-standard-action) action for both rejected and resolved/fulfilled promises. In the case of a rejected promise, an `error` is returned. You can access the promise of the action with `payload.promise`. This is useful for chaining actions together or using `async...await` within an action creator.

## What is the difference between this and other promise middleware?

In issue [#27](https://github.com/pburtchaell/redux-promise-middleware/issues/27), it was asked if this middleware is the same as [acdlite/redux-promise](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-promise). The short answer is that while the middleware solve the same problem, the implementation is different.

The major difference is this middleware dispatches a `_PENDING` action. The pending action enables optimistic updates and provides an action one can use to update the user interface to inform the user a request is being made. This is a feature that acdlite/redux-promise has not implemented at time of writing this (November 2015). A similarity is that both middleware use the [Flux Standard Action](https://github.com/acdlite/flux-standard-action) specification.

One could also argue the API for this middleware is more transparent and easier to integrate, e.g., you do not need to use [redux-actions](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-actions).

## Dispatching actions when promises are resolved

Often times when a promise is resolved, one might want to fire a one or more "callback" actions to respond to the resolved promise. One example is changing the route after a user is successfully signed in.

If you need to do this, you can dispatch a second action:

```js
const firstActionCreator = ({firstParams}) => {
  return {
    type: 'FIRST_ACTION',
    payload: {
      promise: new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        asyncFirst(firstParams).then(firstResult => resolve({secondParams: firstResult}));
      }).then(payload => Promise.resolve({type: 'SECOND_ACTION', payload}))
    }
  };
};
```

If you include [thunk middleware](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) in your middleware stack, it is also possible to use a function to dispatch multiple actions:

```js
const actionCreator = () => ({
  type: 'FIRST_ACTION_TYPE',
  payload: {
    promise: Promise.resolve((action, dispatch, getState) => {
      dispatch({ type: 'SECOND_ACTION_TYPE', payload: ... })
      dispatch(someActionCreator())
    })
   }
});
```

## Type suffix configuration

When adding the promise middleware to your middleware stack, you can supply an optional configuration object. This object accepts an array of suffix strings that can be used instead of the default `['PENDING', 'FULFILLED', 'REJECTED']` with a key of `promiseTypeSuffixes`.

```js
applyMiddleware(
  promiseMiddleware({
    promiseTypeSuffixes: ['LOADING', 'SUCCESS', 'ERROR']
  })
)
```

Alternatively, you can supply the same options at the action level inside the meta options that will change these suffixes on a per action type basis.

```js
export function myAsyncActionCreator(data) {
  return {
    type: 'ACTION',
    payload: {
      promise: doSomethingAsyncAndReturnPromise(data),
      data: data
    },
    meta: {
      promiseTypeSuffixes: ['PENDING', 'H*LL_YEAH', 'SH*T']
    }
  };
}
```
