# Promise Middleware Example

The examples demonstrate using promise middleware to make async requests. There is also a simple example with just Redux. Both examples use [a mocked JSON API](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) with [Faker data](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/).

Addtionally, there is a (partial) complex example that combines Redux with React and React Router. This example is not finished yet. [Do you want to help finish? See issue #33](https://github.com/pburtchaell/redux-promise-middleware/issues/33A).

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies `npm install`
2. Start the app: `npm start`
3. Go to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
