# Using Promise Middleware

This example demonstrates how to use the middleware with default config.

In the example, the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) is used to request an image of a dog from a JSON API (called the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/), woof woof!). When the request is pending, a loading message is rendered. When the request is fulfilled, the image is rendered.

## Getting Started

- Run `npm i webpack webpack-cli -g ` to install global parcel
- Run `npm i` to install dependencies
