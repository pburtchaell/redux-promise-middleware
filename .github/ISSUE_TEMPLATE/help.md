about: Ask for help on a problem

Issues should primarily be used for bug reports and feature requests.

Before you ask for help on a problem, please answer the following questions:

- Am I asking for help on a problem that is unreleated to or outside the scope of this project? (yes/no)
- Can I ask for help on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/redux-promise-middleware) instead of GitHub? (yes/no)

If you answered "yes" to one of those questions, please do not create an issue asking for help. I

Instead, ask a question on StackOverflow with the "redux-promise-middleware" tag. We actively watch [StackOverflow for questions about the middleware](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/redux-promise-middleware) and will help you through that channel.
